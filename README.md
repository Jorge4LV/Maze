# MazeRace
MazeRace is a Discord bot that lets you play maze races with others in real-time.  
This bot was built in ~ 3 days for [DDevs Buildathon 2023][1].

I prefer if you don't run your own instance of the bot, invite it from here instead:  
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=999676682749354055

You can use the source to learn how to make bots with the [discohook][2] library and [deta][3].
